  <p class="founder-bio fade-text">
  Ivy Okyere is the Founder and Executive Director of Grace Givers Ghana, a mission-driven non-governmental organization dedicated to improving the lives of underserved communities through education, health support, and social empowerment. Her passion for community service is grounded in hands-on healthcare experience and a strong commitment to people-centered care, particularly for women and children in low-resource communities.  

  She began her professional journey as a Healthcare Assistant at Owusu Memorial Clinic, later earning formal certification and gaining further practical exposure through a regional hospital internship and patient support roles at Mariana Health Clinic. These experiences shaped her understanding of community health needs and strengthened her dedication to health advocacy and outreach. Ivy holds a BSc in Tourism and Hospitality Management, a background that has enhanced her leadership, communication, and organizational skills, which she later applied in her role as Assistant Administrator at Health Link in 2022.  

  Through the integration of healthcare practice, administrative leadership, and community engagement, Ivy leads Grace Givers Ghana with compassion, professionalism, and a firm belief that sustainable change begins with dignity, opportunity, and hope.
